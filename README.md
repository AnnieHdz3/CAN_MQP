# CAN_MQP

/*
This is Annie Hernandez's edits to an Opencores CAN project. These files are all *.v or *.tb, denoting they are written in and for Verilog.
This repo will not be updated frequently, as it is version control for one person. That being said, major milestones will likely be pushed to avoid lost, destroyed, or incorrectly overwritten file scares.

These modifications are not open source (at least not ta this stage); this is a university project.
